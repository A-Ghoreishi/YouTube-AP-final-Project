## Introduction

The Local YouTube project is a Java-based application designed to replicate the core functionalities of YouTube in a local environment. This project enables users to experience video streaming, playlist management, and content discovery similar to the popular online platform, but entirely offline and localized to their personal devices.

## Backend Components

This part of the project includes 5 classes to handle the function of the project such as:

### Account Class

The Account class manages user account information, specifically handling password hashing for security purposes. It ensures that passwords are stored securely by applying cryptographic hashing algorithms, which convert passwords into irreversible strings of characters, enhancing data protection against unauthorized access.

### ServerHandler Class

The ServerHandler class acts as an intermediary between the client and the server, processing incoming requests from clients and providing appropriate responses. It manages the communication protocol, handling data transmission and ensuring seamless interaction between multiple clients and the server.

### Server Class

The Server class establishes the central server infrastructure for the Local YouTube application. It listens for incoming client connections, manages client sessions, and coordinates data exchange among connected clients. The server class implements multithreading to handle concurrent client requests efficiently and maintains the overall integrity and availability of the application.

### Client Class

The Client class represents the client-side component of the Local YouTube application. It facilitates communication with the server by sending requests, receiving responses, and displaying relevant data to the user interface. The client class manages user interactions, such as video playback requests, search queries, and playlist management, ensuring a responsive and interactive user experience.

### Database Class

The Database class handles data storage and retrieval operations for the Local YouTube application. It stores user account information, video metadata, playlists, and other relevant data in a structured format, ensuring persistent storage and efficient data management. The database class utilizes SQL or NoSQL databases to organize and query data, supporting reliable and scalable data handling capabilities.

These backend components collectively enable the Local YouTube project to deliver robust functionality, secure data management, and seamless communication between users and the application's server infrastructure. Each class plays a crucial role in ensuring the application's reliability, security, and responsiveness to user interactions.

## Frontend Components

The frontend of the Local YouTube project encompasses a diverse range of FXML components, each designed to enhance user interaction and provide a rich multimedia experience. Here are some key FXML components used in the project:

### Homepage

The Homepage serves as the central hub where users land upon logging in. It dynamically displays personalized video recommendations, trending content, and subscription updates, offering a curated browsing experience tailored to each user's preferences.
